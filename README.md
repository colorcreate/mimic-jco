# Mimik Jco

This repo is one of my progress on [_Frondend Roadmap_](https://www.codementor.io/kamranahmedse/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-inb3ay6xt) to duplicate some website

I choose **jcodonuts.com/id** because I know it and I really happy when my friend bring this donuts for free even though I have never bought it by myself

In this repo, I challenge my self to develop my skill, its like:

- **Jumbotron Image Slider:** I really curious about Jumbotron Image Slider and I think _jco_ using _nivo slider_ to manage it, when I searching about it, I found the dead end 
because _nivo slider_ is not for free, so I try another options and I choose _Owl Carousel_ to make Image Slider
- **Single Page Application:** When my friend tell me about SPA (_Single Page Application_) Angular, I challenge my self to create SPA just using _javascript_ 
and I did make it with helping from `window.location` attribute
- **Bootstraps:** I newer used it before, but I try it in this project



### Running the project
1. clone project
2. install all packages using `npm install`
3. run the project using `node server.js` but better using `nodemon server.js`
